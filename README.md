# smkramer-capstone_webapp
 The goal of my Capstone project was to create a database driven web application. The general system design of this application is a meeting scheduler that allows an IU instructor to view teamâ€™s meeting history, create new meeting blocks for each sprint, and create a page for taking meeting notes, which include tasks, notes, ratings, and student attendance. The system design is also for students, where the student may schedule one meeting per sprint and have the ability to view tasks assigned to their team by the instructor. I approached this project by first creating an initial ERD and initial wireframe. The ERD was a necessary tool for planning in order to create a database on SQL that had meaningful relationships between tables. The wireframe was helpful to plan out the general flow and UX of the user experience. My approach was to create the database in MySQL and then began coding the HTML for each page in my workflow, using the Rivet Framework and the FullCalendar documentation. Once the general layout of my pages were created, I then added the PHP and connected it to the database.
